# Lifting maps

Lifting refers to the process of mapping a featured domain to another featured domain via a well-defined procedure. This section shows how we can lift a given domain to a CC or cell complex. Such lifting is useful as it allows CCNNs to be applied to common topological domains, including graphs and cell/simplicial complexes. This section only scratches the surface, as there remain many lifting constructions to be explored. We refer the reader to [@ferri2018simplicial] for examples of lifting graphs to simplicial complexes.

## n-hop CC of a graph

Let $\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$ be a graph and $n\geq 2$ an integer. The $n$*-hop CC* of $\mathcal{G}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_{n-\mbox{hop}}(\mathcal{G})$, is the CC whose $0$-cells, $1$-cells, and $n$-cells are the nodes of $\mathcal{G}$, edges of $\mathcal{G}$, and set nodes in $n$-hop neighborhoods of the nodes in $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_{n-\mbox{hop}}(\mathcal{G})$ is a CC of dimension $n$. Figure \@ref(fig:liftings)(a) visualizes the $1$-hop CC of a graph.

## Path-based and subgraph-based CC of a graph

Let $\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$ be a graph. A natural CC structure on $\mathcal{G}$ considers paths of $\mathcal{G}$. We define a *path-based CC* of $\mathcal{G}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$, to be a CC consisting of $0$-cells, $1$-cells and $2$-cells specified as follows. First, $\mathcal{X}^0$ and $\mathcal{X}^1$ in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ are the sets of nodes and edges of $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $2$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$. Let $P$ be a path in $\mathcal{G}$ with length larger than or equal to two (i.e., with two or more edges). An element $x_P$ in $\mathcal{X}^2$ induced by $P$ is defined to be $x_P=\cup_{v\in P }\{v\}$. The set $\mathcal{X}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ is a non-empty collection of elements $x_P$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G}))=2$. Note that we may replace the path $P$ by a tree/subgraph of graph $\mathcal{G}$ and obtain a similar CC structure induced by the tree/subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$. Figure \@ref(fig:liftings)(b) shows an example of a path-based CC of a graph.

## Loop-based CC of a graph

Let $\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$ be a graph. We associate a CC structure with $\mathcal{G}$ that considers loops in $\mathcal{G}$. We define a *loop-based CC* of $\mathcal{G}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$, to be a CC consisting of $0$-cells, $1$-cells and $2$-cells specified as follows. First, we set $\mathcal{X}^0$ and $\mathcal{X}^1$ in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ to be the nodes and edges of $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $2$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$. A 2-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a set $C=\{x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k\} \subset \mathcal{X}^0$ such that $\{x^0_i,x^0_{i+1}\}$, $1 \leq  i \leq k - 1$, and $\{x^0_k, x^0_1\}$ are the only edges in $\mathcal{X}^1 \cap C$.  The set $\mathcal{X}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a nonempty collection of elements $C$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G}))=2$. Note that the sequence $(x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k)$ defines a loop in $\mathcal{G}$. This loop is called the loop that characterizes the 2-cell $C=\{x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k\}$. Similar constructions are suggested in [@aschbacher1996combinatorial; @basak2010combinatorial; @savoy2022combinatorial; @roddenberry2021signal]. In fact, it is easy to confirm that every 2-dimensional regular cell complex can be constructed in this manner [@roddenberry2021signal]. Figure \@ref(fig:liftings)(c) shows an example of a loop-based CC of a graph.

## Coface CC of a simplicial complex or of a CC

Here, we describe a method to lift a simplicial complex of dimension two to a CC of dimension three. This method can be easily generalized to other dimensions. For a simplicial complex $\mathcal{Y}$ of dimension two, the *coface CC* of $\mathcal{Y}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$, is defined as follows. $\mathcal{Y}^0$, $\mathcal{Y}^1$, and $\mathcal{Y}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ are the nodes, the edges, and the triangles in $\mathcal{Y}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $3$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$. Let $x^2$ be a 2-cell in $\mathcal{Y}$. The 3-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ associated with $x^2$ is the union of all 0-cells in $\mathcal{N}_{co,1}(x^2) \cup x^2$. The set $\mathcal{Y}^3$ in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ is defined as the set of all 3-cells associated with all 2-cells $x^2$ in $\mathcal{Y}$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_{SC}(\mathcal{Y})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_{SC}(\mathcal{Y}) )=3$. A similar lifting construction can be defined to augment any CC of dimension $n$ with $(n+1)$-cells in order to obtain a CC of dimension $n+1$.

## Augmentation of CCs by higher-rank cells

The lifting methods proposed in Sections \@ref(path-based-and-subgraph-based-cc-of-a-graph), \@ref(loop-based-cc-of-a-graph), and \@ref(coface-cc-of-a-simplicial-complex-or-of-a-cc) can be described abstractly under a single general lifting construction. Specifically, the essence of all these lifting methods is to *augment the underlying CC $\mathcal{X}$ with new cells that have a rank of $\dim(\mathcal{X})+1$*. Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc) formalizes the general lifting construction.

```{proposition, augmented-cc, name="Augmenting a CC"}
Let $S$ be a nonempty set and $(S,\mathcal{X},\mbox{rk})$ a CC of dimension $n$ defined on $S$. Consider a set $\mathcal{X}^{n+1} \subset \mathcal{P}(S)$ such that if $x\in\mathcal{X}$ and $y \in \mathcal{X}^{n+1}$ with $x\subseteq y$, then $x\subsetneq y$. Further, consider a map $\hat{\mbox{rk}}\colon \mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1}\to \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ that satisfies $\hat{\mbox{rk}}(x)= \mbox{rk}(x)$ for all $x\in\mathcal{X}$ and $\hat{\mbox{rk}}(x)=n+1$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}^{n+1}$. For $\mathcal{X}^{n+1}$ and $\hat{\mbox{rk}}$ satisfying such conditions, $(S,\mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1},\hat{\mbox{rk}} )$ is a CC of dimension $n+1$.
```

```{proof}
The proof follows directly from Definition \@ref(def:cc).
```

Given a CC $\mathcal{X}$, we call a CC of the form $(S,\mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1},\hat{\mbox{rk}} )$, as constructed in Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc), a *highest-rank augmented CC of $\mathcal{X}$*. Note that Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc) provides a constructive and iterative method to build a CC of arbitrary dimension from a nonempty set $S$ of abstract points.
