# 提升映射{#lifting-maps}

提升是指通过明确定义的程序将一个特征域映射到另一个特征域的过程。本节展示了我们如何将给定域提升到 CC 或胞腔复形。这种提升非常有用，因为它允许 CCNNs 应用于常见的拓扑域，包括图和胞腔/单纯复形。本节只是蜻蜓点水，还有很多提升结构有待探索。关于将图提升到单纯复形的例子，请读者参阅 [@ferri2018simplicial]。

## 图的n-hop CC{#n-hop-cc-of-a-graph}

令$\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$是图，$n\geq 2$是整数。 图$\mathcal{G}$的 $n$*-hop CC*记为$\mbox{CC}_{n-\mbox{hop}}(\mathcal{G})$是一个CC，其$0$-cells、$1$-cells和$n$-cells 分别是$\mathcal{G}$的顶点、边，以及$\mathcal{G}$的顶点的$n$-hop领域集。 很容易验证$\mbox{CC}_{n-\mbox{hop}}(\mathcal{G})$是维度为$n$的CC。图\@ref(fig:liftings)(a) 可视化了图$\mathcal{G}$的$1$-hop CC。

## 图的基于路径和基于子图的CC{#path-based-and-subgraph-based-cc-of-a-graph}

Let $\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$ be a graph. A natural CC structure on $\mathcal{G}$ considers paths of $\mathcal{G}$. We define a *path-based CC* of $\mathcal{G}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$, to be a CC consisting of $0$-cells, $1$-cells and $2$-cells specified as follows. First, $\mathcal{X}^0$ and $\mathcal{X}^1$ in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ are the sets of nodes and edges of $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $2$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$. Let $P$ be a path in $\mathcal{G}$ with length larger than or equal to two (i.e., with two or more edges). An element $x_P$ in $\mathcal{X}^2$ induced by $P$ is defined to be $x_P=\cup_{v\in P }\{v\}$. The set $\mathcal{X}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ is a non-empty collection of elements $x_P$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_p(\mathcal{G}))=2$. Note that we may replace the path $P$ by a tree/subgraph of graph $\mathcal{G}$ and obtain a similar CC structure induced by the tree/subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$. Figure \@ref(fig:liftings)(b) shows an example of a path-based CC of a graph.

## Loop-based CC of a graph

Let $\mathcal{G}=(V(\mathcal{G}),E(\mathcal{G}))$ be a graph. We associate a CC structure with $\mathcal{G}$ that considers loops in $\mathcal{G}$. We define a *loop-based CC* of $\mathcal{G}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$, to be a CC consisting of $0$-cells, $1$-cells and $2$-cells specified as follows. First, we set $\mathcal{X}^0$ and $\mathcal{X}^1$ in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ to be the nodes and edges of $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $2$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$. A 2-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a set $C=\{x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k\} \subset \mathcal{X}^0$ such that $\{x^0_i,x^0_{i+1}\}$, $1 \leq  i \leq k - 1$, and $\{x^0_k, x^0_1\}$ are the only edges in $\mathcal{X}^1 \cap C$.  The set $\mathcal{X}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a nonempty collection of elements $C$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_{loop}(\mathcal{G}))=2$. Note that the sequence $(x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k)$ defines a loop in $\mathcal{G}$. This loop is called the loop that characterizes the 2-cell $C=\{x^0_1, \ldots , x^0_k\}$. Similar constructions are suggested in [@aschbacher1996combinatorial; @basak2010combinatorial; @savoy2022combinatorial; @roddenberry2021signal]. In fact, it is easy to confirm that every 2-dimensional regular cell complex can be constructed in this manner [@roddenberry2021signal]. Figure \@ref(fig:liftings)(c) shows an example of a loop-based CC of a graph.

## Coface CC of a simplicial complex or of a CC

Here, we describe a method to lift a simplicial complex of dimension two to a CC of dimension three. This method can be easily generalized to other dimensions. For a simplicial complex $\mathcal{Y}$ of dimension two, the *coface CC* of $\mathcal{Y}$, denoted by $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$, is defined as follows. $\mathcal{Y}^0$, $\mathcal{Y}^1$, and $\mathcal{Y}^2$ in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ are the nodes, the edges, and the triangles in $\mathcal{Y}$, respectively. We now explain how to construct a $3$-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$. Let $x^2$ be a 2-cell in $\mathcal{Y}$. The 3-cell in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ associated with $x^2$ is the union of all 0-cells in $\mathcal{N}_{co,1}(x^2) \cup x^2$. The set $\mathcal{Y}^3$ in $\mbox{CC}_{SC}( \mathcal{Y})$ is defined as the set of all 3-cells associated with all 2-cells $x^2$ in $\mathcal{Y}$. It is easy to verify that $\mbox{CC}_{SC}(\mathcal{Y})$ is a CC with $\dim(\mbox{CC}_{SC}(\mathcal{Y}) )=3$. A similar lifting construction can be defined to augment any CC of dimension $n$ with $(n+1)$-cells in order to obtain a CC of dimension $n+1$.

## Augmentation of CCs by higher-rank cells

The lifting methods proposed in Sections \@ref(path-based-and-subgraph-based-cc-of-a-graph), \@ref(loop-based-cc-of-a-graph), and \@ref(coface-cc-of-a-simplicial-complex-or-of-a-cc) can be described abstractly under a single general lifting construction. Specifically, the essence of all these lifting methods is to *augment the underlying CC $\mathcal{X}$ with new cells that have a rank of $\dim(\mathcal{X})+1$*. Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc) formalizes the general lifting construction.

```{proposition, augmented-cc, name="Augmenting a CC"}
Let $S$ be a nonempty set and $(S,\mathcal{X},\mbox{rk})$ a CC of dimension $n$ defined on $S$. Consider a set $\mathcal{X}^{n+1} \subset \mathcal{P}(S)$ such that if $x\in\mathcal{X}$ and $y \in \mathcal{X}^{n+1}$ with $x\subseteq y$, then $x\subsetneq y$. Further, consider a map $\hat{\mbox{rk}}\colon \mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1}\to \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ that satisfies $\hat{\mbox{rk}}(x)= \mbox{rk}(x)$ for all $x\in\mathcal{X}$ and $\hat{\mbox{rk}}(x)=n+1$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}^{n+1}$. For $\mathcal{X}^{n+1}$ and $\hat{\mbox{rk}}$ satisfying such conditions, $(S,\mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1},\hat{\mbox{rk}} )$ is a CC of dimension $n+1$.
```

```{proof}
The proof follows directly from Definition \@ref(def:cc).
```

Given a CC $\mathcal{X}$, we call a CC of the form $(S,\mathcal{X}\cup \mathcal{X}^{n+1},\hat{\mbox{rk}} )$, as constructed in Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc), a *highest-rank augmented CC of $\mathcal{X}$*. Note that Proposition \@ref(prp:augmented-cc) provides a constructive and iterative method to build a CC of arbitrary dimension from a nonempty set $S$ of abstract points.
